When attempting to access this at ${pages_url}, I am getting a 404. This could be caused by a couple of things:

- GitHub Pages needs to be enabled on the ${default_branch} branch. You can fix this in the repository settings.
- The **index.html** file is incorrectly named **inde.html**. We will fix this together in class.

Can you fix the first bullet, please?
