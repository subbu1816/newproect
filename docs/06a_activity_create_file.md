### Activity: Edit Your File

Now it is time to put an image and a caption into your file:

1. Find your file, `##-USERNAME.md`.
1. Open your file in your favorite text editor.
1. On line 6, replace the text with your caption.
1. *Save* your file.

> Git doesn't care how you work with your files locally. You can work in your favorite IDE or text editor, or you can use VIM through the command line.
>
> To open your file from the command line, many IDEs and text editors offer shortcuts. For example, use `atom .` to open the project in Atom, and `code .` to open it in Visual Studio Code.
