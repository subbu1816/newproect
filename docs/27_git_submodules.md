## Git submodules

In some instances, you might want to store the contents of another repository within your repository based on a specific commit in that other repository's history. Git provides a functionality to cover this need in the form of Git submodules.

Git submodules enable you to include the contents of another repository based on a specific commit. This means while changes occur in the other repository you are able to continue to utilize that project's history at a specific point.
