## Git stash

Git stash takes the changes you have made to your working tree ("dirty") and puts them in a holding pattern until you are ready to re-apply them, so you have a fresh working directory ("clean").

Common use cases for using git stash are

- Needing to change focus from the task you are currently working on to a new task
- Forgetting to switch working branches
- Needing to apply changes to multiple branches

When these scenarios happen, figuring out what to do with your in-progress work might be difficult. Do you commit it even though it isn't "ready to be committed"? Do you create a new branch with your changes and come back to it? Do you need to delete your changes and just re-create the work when you can come back to this task? Do you manually copy-and-paste the changes across branches?

There are different solutions to these problems, but this section is going to review the use of `git stash` to store changes you have made in the event that you do not want to commit them to the project's history.

### How to use `git stash`

The `git stash` command enables you to store changes that live in the working directory (unstaged changes) and staging area (staged changes) for later use. These stored changes, like the `reflog`, are only reflected on your *local copy* of the repository. The latest stash is stored in `refs/stash` and older stashes are found in the `reflog` of that reference.

You can have multiple stashes, and they can be referenced by specifying the stash index, or they can be named using `reflog` syntax (example: `stash@{2.hours.ago}`). You can also add a descriptive message to stashes with `git stash save "message"`. Once you are ready to retrieve those changes, you can apply and delete them with `git pop` or apply and continue to store them with `git stash apply`.

#### Commands

- `git stash`
  - Use this when you want to record the current working state, but want a clean working directory
  - This will "stash" your local modifications and revert the working directory to match the `HEAD` commit
  - `git stash push`
    - Saves local changes to the stash and then rolls back to `HEAD` in the working tree and index
      - `git stash push -m <message>` gives the message along with the stashed state
      - Options include `-m|--message <message>`, `-p|--patch`, `--`
- `git stash list`
  - This will list all the stashes you have available
- `git stash show`
  - Adds verbosity to `git stash list` and allows you to inspect the stashes
  - `stash@{0}` will always be the most recent stash available
- `git stash drop`
  - Removes the most recent stash entry from the list (i.e. `stash@{0}`)
  - `git stash drop <n>` will drop the specified stash index (example: `git stash drop 2`)
  - **Note:** The stash index will update when you drop a stash
- `git stash clear`
  - Deletes all stashes
- `git stash pop`
  - Removes a single stash and applies it on top of the current working tree
    - The working directory must match the index
    - The `git stash pop` can fail with conflicts and will not be removed from the stash list
      - You must resolve the conflicts manually and `git stash drop` afterwards
- `git stash apply`
  - Similar to `git stash pop`, but does not remove the stash from the stash list
  - Can be useful for applying changes to multiple branches
- `git stash branch`
  - `git stash branch <branchname>` creates and checks out a new branch named `<branchname>` starting from the point the stash was created and applies the stash; if it is successful, it drops the stash
  - Can be useful if you forgot to switch a new branch before starting working
- `git stash create`
  - Create a stash entry and return the object name without storing it in the ref namespace
    - Useful for scripts
    - Easily confused with `git stash push`, but doesn't return a clean working directory
- `git stash store`
  - Store a stash made with `git stash create`
    - Adds it to the stash ref and updates the stash reflog
    - Useful for scripts
    - Easily confused with `git stash push`, but doesn't return a clean working directory
