## Day 1 Activities

### Add a new slide

Just like we did in class, open a new pull request adding a new slide to the deck.

1. Create a new branch, and switch to that branch:

   ```sh
   git switch -c NEWBRANCHNAME
   ```

1. Create a new file in the `_slides` directory:

   ```sh
   touch 00-USERNAME.md
   ```

1. Follow the directions for the same activity we created together, where it says "[Activity: Edit Your File](06_working_locally)".
1. Instead of just adding the caption, you will need to find a new image from the image list and use that to fill in this template:

   ```markdown
   ---
   layout: slide
   ---

   SLIDE-CAPTION

   IMAGE-URL
   {: .center}
   ```

1. Save and commit your changes on your new branch.
1. If working locally, push your changes up to the remote:

   ```sh
   git push -u origin NEWBRANCHNAME
   ```

1. Open a pull request
In the body of the pull request, @ mention anyone you'd like to review your changes.
1. Once the tests pass on your pull request, merge the pull request.

### Add a caption to an existing slide

Add a caption to an existing slide in someone else's pull request.

1. Find a pull request that you'd like to add a caption to.
1. See what image they have chosen by clicking 'files changed', and then 'view'.
1. Edit the file, either in the browser or locally, to add a line with your caption. (Please do not erase work that others have added to this file.)
    - If you are working locally, you will need to check out to the branch.
    - Make sure you have all the remote changes updated in your local repository: `git pull`.
    - Look for the name of the branch in the pull request, and check out to that branch locally: `git switch BRANCHNAME`.
1. Save the changes, and commit the file.
    - If you are working locally, push the changes up to the remote: `git push`.
1. Do not merge the pull request, simply `@` mention the user who opened the pull request to let them know about your changes.

### Improve the `README.md`

Improve our `README.md` by adding some of your favorite resources.

1. Create branch, and switch to that branch: `git switch -c NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. Edit the README.md to be better in some way. This could mean adding a new resource, or making the existing descriptions more clear. Save and commit your changes.
1. If working locally, push your changes up to the remote: `git push -u origin NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. Open a pull request
In the body of the pull request, with `base: main` and `compare: NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. `@` mention anyone you'd like to review your changes.
1. Once the tests pass on your pull request, merge the pull request.

### Restyle slides

If you'd like a more advanced challenge, and you have an eye for style, change the colors, font, and other aspects of the class slide deck. **Note: If multiple participants attempt this, there may be merge conflicts.**

1. Create a new branch and check out to it: `git switch -c NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. Find the file `_sass/solarized/solarized.scss`.
1. Make changes in the file.
    - Lines 12-19 affect colors
    - Lines 33-35 affect font and font size
    - Lines 52-55 affect headers
1. Save and commit your changes on your branch.
1. Push your branch to the remote: `git push -u origin NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. Open a pull request with `base: main` and `compare: NEWBRANCHNAME`.
1. `@` mention anyone you'd like to review your changes.
1. Once the tests pass on your pull request, merge the pull request.
