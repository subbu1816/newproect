## Case studies

While starting something new at an organization always has unique challenges, there are likely others in similar fields who can offer their expertise. Let's learn from the experience of others.

We've put together some resources on the following topics:

- Creating an innersource culture
- Leadership as an internal stakeholder
- Open Source for Enterprises
- Teaching Git & GitHub
- GitHub workflow success stories

Each topic has a list of resources (articles, white papers, videos, etc.) and a list of discussion questions. As a group, we'll focus on the same topic.

1. First, we'll each get to know the available resources and respond to issue prompts individually. You won't have time to get through every resource, and that's OK.
1. Then, as a group, we'll discuss the prompts. Most importantly, we'll discuss how the information is useful within your organization.
