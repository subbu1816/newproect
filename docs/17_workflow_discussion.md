## Discussion Guide: Team workflows and branching strategies

Now is a good time to discuss workflows - what works for you and your team, what might work, and what you've been doing in the past. Here are some topics you will want to discuss with your team as you establish your ideal process.  Have a conversation either synchronously or in issues in the class repository about different workflows.

1. Which branching strategy will we use?
1. Which branch will serve as our "main" or deployed code?
1. How will you protect your code?
1. Will we use naming conventions for our branches?
1. How will we use labels and assignees?
1. Will we use milestones?
1. Will we have required elements of Issues or Pull Requests (e.g. shipping checklists)?
1. Who is expected to review your work? Do you plan to involve other teams?
1. How will we indicate sign-off on Pull Requests?
1. Who will merge pull requests?
1. How will you teach your workflow to your team? If it already exists, how is it taught to new hires?
1. What integrations will be used in different stages of development? Will all teams be using the same tools?
1. If users have questions about Git, GitHub, or their workflows, who do they ask? How do they know who to ask?
